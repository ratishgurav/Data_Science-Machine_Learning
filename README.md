# ⚙️ Under the Hood: ML & DS

> *"It's not enough to just call .fit()."*

This repository documents my journey in Machine Learning. Instead of just using libraries blindly, I am writing algorithms from scratch to understand the math, then implementing them in **TensorFlow** to master the optimization.

## 📂 Contents

* **Foundations:** NumPy implementations of Linear Algebra.
* **From Scratch:** Writing Gradient Descent and Backpropagation without frameworks.
* **Deep Learning:** Neural Networks built with TensorFlow/Keras.
* **Data Analysis:** Exploratory analysis on real-world datasets.

## 🚀 How to Run

Clone the repo and install the basics:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/ratishgurav/My_Python_Projects.git](https://github.com/ratishgurav/My_Python_Projects.git)
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
jupyter notebook
