# ⚙️ Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio

> *"It's not enough to just call .fit()."*

This repository documents my journey in Machine Learning. Instead of just using libraries blindly, I am writing algorithms from scratch to understand the math, then implementing them in **TensorFlow** and **Scikit-Learn** to master the optimization.

## 📂 Featured Projects

### ❤️ Heart Disease Classification
A classification project to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on medical attributes.
* **Goal:** Classify patients as having heart disease or not.
* **Tech:** `Scikit-Learn`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`.
* **Location:** `/project_heart_disease`

## 📚 Library Foundations
I firmly believe in mastering the basics. These folders contain my detailed study notebooks for core Python libraries:
* **NumPy:** `/numpy` - Linear algebra and array manipulation.
* **Pandas:** `/pandas` - Data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib:** `/matplotlib` - Data visualization.
* **Scikit-Learn:** `/scikitlearn` - ML algorithms and preprocessing.

## 🏆 Kaggle & External Notebooks
I also publish experiments and competition notebooks on Kaggle. Check them out here:
